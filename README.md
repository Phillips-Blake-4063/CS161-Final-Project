# CS161-Final-Project
I spent too much time and frustration trying to fix my stock webscraper, to no resolve. I didn't know what else I could do, so I scrapped the whole project to get it out of my mind. 

So instead, my project now uses Pyqt. I'm happy with the result, I think creating classes and functions is much more practical with this module.
